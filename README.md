# Board-Game

This is the 6th project made during my front end developer course.

The project was to make a turn based board game using javascript and jquery.

This project has been since updated to be written with just javascript to use more recent JS.

The Js code has been seperated into different files to be more readable:

* board.js : Creation of the main board
* player.js: Creation of the player characters
* weapon.js: Creation of the weapons and pickable items on the board
* combat.js: Code once the two players meet and fight until one has defeated the other
